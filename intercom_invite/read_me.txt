This program is a short OOP designed program to take in json customers with
ID and longitude and latitude coordinates and match against home coordinates
for purposes of producing a party invite list within 100km of home office. 

I made a mess of it for the intercom test due to unfortunate circumstances
at the time (my fault, not giving myself enough time) but now got to fix it 
up my errored code and do it more correctly then last time. Good practice
and with a little upgrade making the distance variable and home coordinates
variable, it may provide useful. If you would like me to do this for you
free of charge, just let me know and I will do a V2 in python posting on
github. My email is johnmlhll@yahoo.com or connect via LinkedIn | Twitter

I used .gitignore to remove the production build files/folders that were
produced by pyinstaller.
